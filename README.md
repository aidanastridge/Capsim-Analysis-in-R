[Capsim](https://www.capsim.com/) is Business Simulation where 5 teams compete over 8 years. Teams are given the ability to control Research, Production, Marketing, Finance, Total Quality Management, and Human Resources of their organziation. Ultimatly, my team (Andrews) won the competiton and within 95% of all 2000 Capism teams across the globe. However, we made some siginificant decisions in the mid-game that slowed our progress. I got too invovled in min-maxing when we could have easily made the best product.

### Datasets
